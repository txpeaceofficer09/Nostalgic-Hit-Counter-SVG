# Nostalgic-Hit-Counter-SVG
A PHP generated hit counter straight out of the 90s web.

There is an example at https://www.trap-nine.com/api/counter.php.  You can use &lt;img src="https://www.trap-nine.com/api/counter.php" /&gt; to see it in action.

To use the counter.php file, you just need to upload it to your server, change the mysqli username, password and database to match your server and then reference it inside an img tag &lt;img src="/path/to/counter.php" /&gt;.

It uses a cookie to make sure impressions are only counted once-per-day.
